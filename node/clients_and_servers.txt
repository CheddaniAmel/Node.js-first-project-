---communication between browser and server(with node za3ma)---
well we type a website adress and press enter that sends a request to the server who looks to that request and decide what to send back to the browser(html css images ... )  
how we know which sever we go to when we write the domain name in the browser

---IP Addressess and Domains 
 if u create and publish a website it will be hosted on a computer somewhere and that computer will have an IP @
 since IP @ is a serie of numbers so for that we mask these IP @ with domains
imagine u type the instagram.com in the browser and u hit enter then the browser will look for the associate ip @ for this domain and then use it to connect to the server on the host computer and then the servr will look at that request and respond 

 this connection between the browserand the server is via http(hyper text transer protocol) which are a set of instructions which dectate how communication occurs
