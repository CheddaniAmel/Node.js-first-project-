With our fiction issue last year,
 we began a partnership with Luminato,
  the Toronto Festival of Arts and
   Creativity, which shares our love 
   of literature. Building on the success
    of that first outing, which included
     participation by some of our editors
      and authors in the festival, we have
 jointly decided this year to raise our ambition by creating the supplement, which will include, along with half a dozen short stories, a powerful essay on writing and loss by Joyce Carol Oates. We think—we hope!—we are seeing renewed interest in the short story. Last fall, we started a digital fiction series, publishing to the Amazon Kindle two short stories a month by authors like Christopher Buckley, Curtis Sittenfeld, and Paul Theroux. All told, The Atlantic is now publishing more fiction than it has since the mid-1970s.
